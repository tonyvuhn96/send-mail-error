# Error Log Processing and Email Notification Script

This script is designed to handle error log files, compress them into ZIP archives, upload them to an Amazon S3 bucket, and send email notifications using Amazon SES. It is intended to be scheduled to run at a specific time every day using the node-schedule library.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this script, you must have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account with the following configured:
  - AWS S3 credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) for file storage.
  - AWS SES credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) for sending emails.
  - An S3 bucket for storing log archives.
- A `.env` file with the necessary environment variables set up (e.g., AWS credentials, S3 bucket name, SES credentials, etc.).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd error-log-processing-script
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure the `.env` file with your AWS and other environment variables:

   ```dotenv
   AWS_S3_ID=YOUR_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   AWS_S3_SECRET=YOUR_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
   AWS_SES_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_SES_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   AWS_SES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   AWS_SES_REGION=YOUR_SES_REGION
   AWS_SES_API_VERSION=YOUR_SES_API_VERSION
   MAIL_LIST=recipient1@example.com,recipient2@example.com
   ```

## Usage

To run the script manually, use the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

By default, the script is scheduled to run every day at 8:00 PM (20:00) using node-schedule. You can adjust the schedule by modifying the `cron` expression in the code:

```javascript
const cron = schedule.scheduleJob("00 20 * * *", async () => {
  // ...
});
```

## Workflow

1. The script copies the contents of the `error.log` file to a new file with a timestamp in the filename (e.g., `error_YYYY_MM_DD`).

2. It compresses the log file into a ZIP archive and uploads it to the specified AWS S3 bucket.

3. After successful upload, it sends email notifications to the recipients listed in the `.env` file, containing links to the uploaded log files on AWS S3.
